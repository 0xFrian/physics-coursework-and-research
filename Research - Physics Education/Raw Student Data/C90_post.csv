I also think that the homework did not prepare me for the Departmental Exams at all, and I don’t know that I can pass them. The homework was too difficult and the notes never matched what we were assigned for problem set problems. It felt very unconnected and confusing to have such differently leveled material for each assignment type. I also think that there were way too many deadlines for assignments which did not help learn anything. Commenting on videos doesn’t help to learn, neither did the problem set check ins or the mandatory group work. On Wednesday group meetings, we usually sat there waiting to get solutions and no one ever knew what they were doing because the problem set problems were way too difficult for anyone to solve alone compared to the material on the readiness assurance problems, which were just the right level of difficulty. We should have been practicing problems more similar to the Departmental Exam problems much more often, as now I have to really study hard to get ready for the next two exam takes, and I don’t feel ready at all. The idea of the grading scheme change and the prepping for Physics 7C was good, but a lot needs to change and be fixed for this class to be what I expected it to be. I regret not toughing it out and remaining in Physics 7C where I originally was before dropping it and taking this course, thinking it would prepare me better for 7C, but I honestly feel like I know just as much as I did before coming to this class and I am still not completely ready for 7C. I did not like the 7C Professor as he was very scattered and disorganized and made me extremely fearful to remain in that class, and he is the only Professor teaching it, and I have to take him next quarter. I loved the Professor of this class (Physics 2) and really wish she was teaching Physics 7C, as I would feel much better with her running the class. Her teaching itself was great, and the notes were easy to follow and understand. My issues are only with the assignments themselves, the amount of deadlines, and the group work. The Professor is awesome.",0,,0,,0.0,"Neutral,Neutral",0.0,,,,,,,Not at all helpful,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,"All,No one",0.5,,0,We could have gone slower through the projectile type problems and practiced problems more often with people who actually knew what they were doing. My groups were not helpful throughout the entire course.,0,We could have had some interesting physics demos being posted on Canvas where we could view them later and learn from them. I did not feel as interested being forced to stay late in class to see the couple of demos that were shown to us.,0,"We could have had more practice problems similar to the Departmental Exam problems and we could have been walked through them by the Professor or the teaching team together in class and been able to ask questions instead of wasting time sitting with our groups and waiting for the solutions. The teaching team could have been a little more helpful in that regard, as well. I felt like they were just trying to get in and then leave. The idea of learning from a group when we are all unfamiliar with the topic is very pointless. So much time was wasted that could have been spent really learning via going through problems together (with someone who definitely knew what they were doing) and maybe having students attempt problems in class via screen share while we all worked on them and watched the student work and be corrected by the Professor. This would have been much more beneficial for learning how to solve physics problems.",0,"As I said, we should have worked in class with someone knowledgeable leading us through practice problems, not working in groups with people who had no idea what they were doing either or knew just as much or as little as I did. The problem set problems had a huge gap of difficulty and we were not lead at the right pace to be able to solve those problems. We leaped from sort of doable to what the heck is this!? The solutions always made my jaw drop and made me scratch my head at the thought that we were expected to be able to figure out page long solutions completely on our own having only seen easy examples in the notes.",0,"No more groups please! Maybe working as a class, yes. But people tend to disappoint, there needs to be someone knowledgeable leading the group work from the beginning.",0,"Make PDF version of notes, keep Canvas organized, keep the schedule organized, and only make deadlines for assignments maybe once a week but only for assignments that actually will help with learning the material. No more check ins, instead, maybe a problem or two that only focuses on concepts and not solving anything, that might work. But make one or two deadlines tops. We hate deadlines, all students do, especially during the pandemic. We need to have freedom to work on things at our own pace or at the time that fits us best. Some students work better at night, some work better early in the morning, some need a day or two to prepare and then knock it out in a long sitting. Let us do what works for us. Maybe ask us what works via a survey or something",0,I hope that the course gets changed to match my suggestions so that I wouldn’t have to tell the incoming student anything in order to be prepared.,0,"Please take my suggestions seriously. I actually took the course, I am not dumb, and I know what works for students like myself, I spoke with many during this course. We all agree.",0,"No problem! I hope that you take my suggestions and advice seriously, I want the class to be what I thought it was going to be and what I know that it could be. Good luck with everything!",0,
