The purpose of the questionnaire is to help improve this course for you and future students. By completing this questionnaire as candidly as possible -- with your GUT INSTINCT rather than what you think we want to hear, you help us help you!
This is scored for completion. Your answers will not affect your grade in any way.  Results are reviewed only after removing students' identifying information.
