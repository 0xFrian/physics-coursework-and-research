This GitHub repository is an archive of materials associated with my physics coursework and research at UC Irvine. 

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Teaching
These lesson plans are catered towards health students (biology, public health, pharmacy, etc.) taking introductory physics courses (PHYSICS 3A, 3B, and 3C at UC Irvine).
- [PHYSICS 3B - Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism](https://github.com/0xFrian/physics-coursework-and-research/tree/main/Teaching%20-%20PHYSICS%203%20Series/Physics%203B%20(Fluid%20Mechanics%2C%20Thermodynamics%2C%20Electromagnetism))
- [PHYSICS 3C - Wave Mechanics and Optics](https://github.com/0xFrian/physics-coursework-and-research/tree/main/Teaching%20-%20PHYSICS%203%20Series/Physics%203C%20(Wave%20Mechanics%20and%20Optics))

### üî¨ Research - Condensed Matter Physics
LabView can be used to automate the imaging process of an atomic force microscope (AFM). This LabView code controls the AFM's motors to move the sample stage while accessing the AFM's camera to see which part of the PCB is being imaged. With the help of LabView's pattern recognition tools, we can search for specific patterns in our PCB's lithography and extract the coordinates of our location. From there, we can systematically move to the target region we wish to image.

### üî¨ Research - Physics Education 
Surveys are a great tool to identify common patterns and ideas in education. This survey is designed to assess students' attitude and mindset towards physics and learning physics. In this case, the survey was distributed on Canvas to students enrolled in introductory physics courses (PHYSICS 2 at UC Irvine). My code takes in raw CSV data from Canvas containing students' responses, and then filters the data to produce a "polished" data set that is much easier to work with.
